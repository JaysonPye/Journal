# May

## Backlog for May is as per the google doc

- Personally, I want to sort out homework for LMS as well as go through the laundry list of changes that Luis needs, there are many small bugs from an admins perspective that make it tough to use.
- I also want to diagnose the notifications issues, right now users can't really use the support system properly.

### 05/02

- Epipen test added
- Long meeting with Leroy/Jack to go over tasks
- New setup required from work from home so I spent some time optimising the dev environment to make things faster in the future.
- Setsumeikai calendar had cutoff times at 6pm I edited it to happen at 5:30 instead.
- Checked photobook site passwords / reliability since I had many warnings about errors happening, there doesn't seem to be any actual issues happening so I will have to check at a more peak timing and review the logs.

### 05/01

- Sorted tasks to begin, the backlog of work is extensive so this week I have decided to primarily clean up things that are half finished.
- Seasonal site messages from sms answered and changes added.
- LMS has many translation errors, I went through and added all the changes.
- Found the issue with notifications, it was an issue with how links are created and redirected to with multiple domains, this may need to be reworked entirely in the future if we start to have a lot of concurrent notifications being posted.
- Deployed today's changes which includes translations and notifications bugfixes.
