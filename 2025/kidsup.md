# May

## Backlog for May is as per the google doc

- Personally, I want to sort out homework for LMS as well as go through the laundry list of changes that Luis needs, there are many small bugs from an admins perspective that make it tough to use.
- I also want to diagnose the notifications issues, right now users can't really use the support system properly.

### 05/01

- Sorted tasks to begin, the backlog of work is extensive so this week I have decided to primarily clean up things that are half finished.
- Seasonal site messages from sms answered and changes added.
- LMS has many translation errors, I went through and added all the changes.
