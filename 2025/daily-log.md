- [] Japanese Study
- [x] IT Self-Study
- [] Freelance Work / Client Search

üìù Notes:
- Exercise: Back is feeling a bit better which is good, went for a run.
- Study: Decided I should work through Odin stuff for react and js, I feel like my actual just programming skills have worsened, in terms of simple leetcode style problem solving. I spend most of the time figuring out routes and front end stuff lately.

üìù Notes:
Exercise: My back is officially ruined, not sure how it can still be so sore so this might be chair related, trying to fix my posture a little through the day.
Dev work: Decided the best time to practice my new setup is learning new projects, so i'll be continuing that old odin project react course, might help with productivity on github.
Kidsup: designing and implementing bulk billing procedures which is both interesting and kind of scary.

üìù Notes:
- Japanese: Didn't have time to study much which bothers me.
- Exercise: "Back is still ruined from rows, but went for a run!
- Dev work: Been addicted to building up my linux environment lately, but it feels a bit like procrastination as that is taking over actual study, or is this also study?
Also fixed up a few things on an old react site.

üìù Notes:
Already getting inconsistent with these entries which bothers me, it seems if I don't have actual Kids Up work it's hard to think about doing my Journal, I will improve!
Exercise: Really sore from daily workouts so I am having a rest today, maybe i'll run at night.
Kidsup: Remodelling a system I added previously, as I move into using nvim over vscode I am realizing how hard it is to manage my git tree without a visual representation.
Freelance work: It's harder to bring in a bunch of new stuff than I thought, but I definitely haven't been as consistent as I would like.

üìù Notes:
Youtube: I am still considering if I should even be going in this direction, it would be a nice thing to track / check myself but it's also just more work for not a lot of reward.
Wins: Fixed some server crash issues for kids up, which taught me a little more about how to diagnose issues on linux.
JP thoughts: Still not using anki, need to set a daily goal
Exercise: Started using dumbells at home and i'll just do intro lifting until the local gym reopens.

üìù Notes:
Mood: Fantastic, very motivated at the moment.
Wins: I am getting some time to clean up a lot of messy code for kidsup
JP thoughts: I really need to stay consistent with Anki, and to read as a hobby.
IT thoughts: Dual booting linux on my home PC has taught me a lot, going to make the switch to nvim from tomorrow as i've been working on my nvim setup. I chose to go with lazyvim.
Exercise: I've been doing a terrible job on this front as I was waiting for my old gym to reopen to which is hasn't, might start a proper schedule with dumbells at home rather than just aerobic stuff.
