üìù Notes:
- Kidsup IT: Made time estimates for most tasks that I could.
- Exercise: Managed to get in a really good workout, trying to be consistent putting this at the utmost priority and it's working.
- General: I think I can be much more productive, I keep overwhelming myself with how many tasks I want to complete, need to try this new method of less pressure.

üìù Notes:
- Kidsup IT: managed to fix a few big bugs today that were sitting there needing to be done for a while now.
- Study: Got some practice in with nvim stuff, but actually for KidsUP work I've been using vscode and I kind of feel like as I get better at it it might be better for me. We will see as i continue to practice this a little bit.
- Exercise: As I said this will become a priority, I decided that this is the one non excusable thing I need to do every single day, before I moved to Japan fitness was my lifestyle really, my hobby. As I lived far from a gym here and corona happened I kind of fell off the wagon and it's at a point now where I kind of hate myself for it, the journey to healing that starts with making sure I work out daily and can get myself back into that sort of culture.

üìù Notes:

- Incredibly sick today, woke up with a searing headache at 3am and a fever, just pushing through to get basic things done.
- Exercise: From Thursday this will become the new priority to make sure I can get it done daily.

## 2025-05-20 (Tuesday)

- [x] Exercise
- [x] Kids Up IT Work Block (10am-2pm)
- [] Japanese Study
- [x] IT Self-Study
- [] Freelance Work / Client Search

üìù Notes:
- Need to rework how I am doing my schedule, maybe I might move the part time block to the afternoon, it's easier to focus hard when it is paid work so 
I think if i can move my study related things to the morning when I am the most motivated that might fit better.
- For today I am doing KU work through the usual 10-2 block.
- Managed to do some good IT study and I am having better discipline with doing TDD development every time rather than taking shortcuts here and there.
There is surely a balance between doing things the 'most optimal way' and speed so I am trying to find that balance, but the end result must be a good product.

üìù Notes:
- Exercise: Back is feeling a bit better which is good, went for a run.
- Study: Decided I should work through Odin stuff for react and js, I feel like my actual just programming skills have worsened, in terms of simple leetcode style problem solving. I spend most of the time figuring out routes and front end stuff lately.

üìù Notes:
Exercise: My back is officially ruined, not sure how it can still be so sore so this might be chair related, trying to fix my posture a little through the day.
Dev work: Decided the best time to practice my new setup is learning new projects, so i'll be continuing that old odin project react course, might help with productivity on github.
Kidsup: designing and implementing bulk billing procedures which is both interesting and kind of scary.

üìù Notes:
Already getting inconsistent with these entries which bothers me, it seems if I don't have actual Kids Up work it's hard to think about doing my Journal, I will improve!
Exercise: Really sore from daily workouts so I am having a rest today, maybe i'll run at night.
Kidsup: Remodelling a system I added previously, as I move into using nvim over vscode I am realizing how hard it is to manage my git tree without a visual representation.
Freelance work: It's harder to bring in a bunch of new stuff than I thought, but I definitely haven't been as consistent as I would like.

üìù Notes:
Youtube: I am still considering if I should even be going in this direction, it would be a nice thing to track / check myself but it's also just more work for not a lot of reward.
Wins: Fixed some server crash issues for kids up, which taught me a little more about how to diagnose issues on linux.
JP thoughts: Still not using anki, need to set a daily goal
Exercise: Started using dumbells at home and i'll just do intro lifting until the local gym reopens.

JP thoughts: I really need to stay consistent with Anki, and to read as a hobby.
IT thoughts: Dual booting linux on my home PC has taught me a lot, going to make the switch to nvim from tomorrow as i've been working on my nvim setup. I chose to go with lazyvim.
Exercise: I've been doing a terrible job on this front as I was waiting for my old gym to reopen to which is hasn't, might start a proper schedule with dumbells at home rather than just aerobic stuff.
