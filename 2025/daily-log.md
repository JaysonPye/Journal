üìù Notes:
Mood: Fantastic, very motivated at the moment.
Wins: I am getting some time to clean up a lot of messy code for kidsup
JP thoughts: I really need to stay consistent with Anki, and to read as a hobby.
IT thoughts: Dual booting linux on my home PC has taught me a lot, going to make the switch to nvim from tomorrow as i've been working on my nvim setup. I chose to go with lazyvim.
Exercise: I've been doing a terrible job on this front as I was waiting for my old gym to reopen to which is hasn't, might start a proper schedule with dumbells at home rather than just aerobic stuff.
