# Keys

- work on parents side

# Teacher view

- Graph for test percentages over time for teacher view -- in place of badge thing

# Parents view

- Find child to better text
- Clear instructions
- Manual for parents
- Remove edit sheet
- Milestones Shown in a graph -- get ideas
- badge graph top right, graph bottom right
- landing page should have advertisements, announcements, kids stuff, add child (modal for form)
- Contact Details for the school instead of support requests
- When a child quits need to reverse engineer SS child uploads so we can deactivate the parents account and keep timestamps
- Inactive/active kids should be off the attendance lists etc, but parents are paying during a break so they shouldn't be made inactive

# Reviews

- Add a separate view form to give feedbak taking the params from the current lesson they clicked from
- Button at the bottom of modal
- Generation questions
- First implement and test it out at existing test school
- View sends it to the admin
- Feedback submitted should be accessible on the writer view
- Needs models, or maybe jsonb on the side of the lesson itself
- Probably it's own table with lesson id connecting
- Output it to either csv or a toggle button for editors to show list of reviews
