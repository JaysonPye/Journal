## Projects
- Journal
- LMS

### What I did
- Added templates for a daily journal and created a script to generate daily templates
- Reviewed previously entered code from the LMS in order to add a copy as template button for lessons as requested by the curriculum team

### What I learned
- As I'm still new to ruby I am learning a lot about syntax and the coding conventions expected when using rails.
