# FEB 2025 carryover from January w/ estimates where possible

## To do list

- Decide how to handle level up table

- Have student progress table prioritize the recent level and don't show dates past current level
- Rework homework to it's own view / models to help writer's management.
- Seasonal should have a season on model and search parameters for that
- Shouldnt show course in monthly materials to teachers view.
- filter school number on the stats sheet too

## SS IDEAS

- Save object with all data for historical first, scale it back after first updates are done.
