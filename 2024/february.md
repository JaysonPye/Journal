# FEB 2025 carryover from January w/ estimates where possible

## To do list

- Decide how to handle level up table
- SS uploads recording historical data
- Notifications bug
- Styling bug report on card
- Have student progress table prioritize the recent level and don't show dates past current level
- Rework homework to it's own view / models to help writer's management.
- Seasonal should have a season on model and search parameters for that
- Shouldnt show course in monthly materials to teachers view.

## SS IDEAS

- Save object with all data for historical first, scale it back after first updates are done.
- Have schoolID come in automatically based on leroy's sheet, i'll provide the sheet and he has to meet my expectations.
- SSID, SchoolID, name, en_name, land/sky/gx/ku/spc dates

# 04/02

- Multiple IP validation added
- level up table to populate via manual changes and test results
- Level ups now create based on both test changes and manual changes, dated etc.
- Organise proper framework for ss uploading, start with making sure historical data works.
- Anything after 2022
