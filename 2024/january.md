## General changes - 30-40 hours? Lesson plans and tags could take a very long time or not that much.

- A lot of documentation (5-8 hours work)
- Student model needs sex, allergies, status(enum for kyuukai quit current)
- All lessons need partner lessons to connect
- Date of level ups in its own model
- Styling depending on the URL params eg hub.kids-up.app vision-up.app, these should use the dark mode functionality but take out border radius
- Lesson plans need two versions and should have one set linked to the kidsup org and the others linked to everyone else (but possibly completely org dependent in the future). Whenever a guide is created it should create TWO of the guides and assign to both. Potentially look into stamping each document in a footer, look into if this can be done to individual document uploads.

- IP LOCKING
- Dump seasonal school picture & date


[x] Branding based on URL params
[] Styling based on params (kids up colors to test KU, rest same)
