# I thought I'd set out some learning goals for November here

## Read a chapter of practical vim weekly and solely use nvim during personal study time

## Continue using TMUX and try to never use a mouse

## Become comfortable in hjkl movements

## Work through odin project JS side with peter but also Ruby side whenever I'm ahead

### 11/3

- Completed Odin's sign up page html/css project. Honestly I've usually frameworks too much so I feel like my baseline html/css skills are underwhelming. Completing this course is giving me a lot more confidence that I can find answers quickly, it also helps me diagnose problems faster.
- Read a chapter of the rails 7 way which had to do with mailing services, learned a lot about current work mailers and how they are being used in our projects currently.
- Took a look at the setsumeikai React app in order to fix a few issues that the department head asked me to look into.

### 11/4

- Studied intermediate grids on odin project
- Adapted some views on world projects
- Troubleshooted mail issues created by replacing SES secret key

### 11/5

- Mostly problem solving with a few issues at work, particularly SES mailer servies as well as DB_PROTOTYPE survey functions
- Turns out surveys were refactored at some point and not tested properly, so responses aren't recorded and creation/deletion from front end were broken.
- I adapted some of the old functions to get it working, still a bit to do on 11/6.

### 11/6

- Troubleshooted Surveys in order to create admin views for create/edit actions, they were previously added but seemed to be incomplete/completely non functional.

### 11/9

- Continued efforts to improve at front end coding speed and knowledge.
- Grid examples completed and subsequent odin project learning materials studied.
- Worked on larger odin project for intermediate grids.

### 11/12

- Reworked some app site forms that broke when they were refactored.
- intermediate grid project studied, learned a lot about nesting grids within grids within grids and how well you can position things.
- Again realized that my front end skills need work, I think it is just reps so that I can code quickly without wasting time looking for syntax or resaving the file to see positioning with certain commands
