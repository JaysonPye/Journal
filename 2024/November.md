# I thought I'd set out some learning goals for November here

## Read a chapter of practical vim weekly and solely use nvim during personal study time

## Continue using TMUX and try to never use a mouse

## Become comfortable in hjkl movements

## Work through odin project JS side with peter but also Ruby side whenever I'm ahead
