# I thought I'd set out some learning goals for November here

## Read a chapter of practical vim weekly and solely use nvim during personal study time

## Continue using TMUX and try to never use a mouse

## Become comfortable in hjkl movements

## Work through odin project JS side with peter but also Ruby side whenever I'm ahead

### 11/3

- Completed Odin's sign up page html/css project. Honestly I've usually frameworks too much so I feel like my baseline html/css skills are underwhelming. Completing this course is giving me a lot more confidence that I can find answers quickly, it also helps me diagnose problems faster.
- Read a chapter of the rails 7 way which had to do with mailing services, learned a lot about current work mailers and how they are being used in our projects currently.
- Took a look at the setsumeikai React app in order to fix a few issues that the department head asked me to look into.
